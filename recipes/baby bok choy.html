	<h1>Garlic Ginger Baby Bok Choy</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
	<li>2 garloc cloves, sliced thinly</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
	<li>10-12 baby bok choy (cut in half length-wise, 		root and leaves trimmed)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup water, plus more as needed</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch or flour</li>
	<li>sesame seeds or furikake for garnish</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Heat the sesame oil in a pan with a lid over 	 high heat.</li>
	<li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook for a 		couple minutes, be sure the garlic doesn't burn.	</li>
	<li>Add the soy sauce, then the baby bok choy, 		constantly stirring the baby bok choy until it is 		coated with sauce mixture.</li>
	<li>Add 1/4 cup water and cover the pan with a 		lid. Steam the baby bok choy until the stem end 	is tender, about 4-5 minutes. Add more water if 	necessary.</li>
	<li>While the baby bok choy is steaming make a 		slurry of the cornstarch or flour with some water 	  to form a thick paste.</li>
	<li>Once the baby bok choy is done steaming push 	 the baby bok choy to the sides of the pan and        pour the slurry into the center, stirring to make    a sauce. It should thicken and become glossy. Add 	 water if sauce is too thick.</li>
	<li>Remove the baby bok choy to a platter, pour 	the sauce over the top and garnish with the 			sesame seeds or furikake.</li>
