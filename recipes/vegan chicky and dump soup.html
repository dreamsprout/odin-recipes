	<h1>Vegan Chicken and Dumpling Soup Recipe</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>For the Soup:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
	<li>1 large carrot, sliced thin</li>
	<li>2 medium gold potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
	<li>3 large cloves of garlic, minced</li>
	<li>6 cups vegetable broth</li>
	<li>2/3 cups frozen corn</li>
	<li>2/3 cups frozen peas</li>
	<li>black pepper and sea salt, added to your 		preference
</ul>

<p>For the Dumplings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup unbleached, all-purpose white 			 	flour</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
	<li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon pink salt</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
	<li>1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk (or another 		plant-based milk)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons canola oil (or another oil of 	choice)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>In a large soup pot, combine onions, carrots, potatoes, garlic, and not-chicken broth. Heat on medium high and bring to a boil; cook (uncovered) for about 15 minutes. Add frozen corn and peas, cook an addition 15 minutes, until potatoes are almost done (use a fork to pierce potatoes to check).</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, begin making the dumplings. I like to use my stand mixer for these, but a medium bowl and a fork will work fine also! Start by mixing together dry ingredients. Then, either with a mixer OR by hand, slowly pour in the soy milk and canola oil, using your fork to whisk as you go. The dumplings should be combined well and STICKY. Set aside until the soup is ready for you to drop them in.</li>
	<li>Once the potatoes are close to done, and you have a good boil going, drop the dumplings by small spoonfuls into the pot. I like to work my way around the soup pot, making sure to fit as many as I can in! Once you are finished, the entire top of your pot should be filled in with dumplings. This recipe makes about 20, but it varies depending on how big you make them. Once you have all your dumplings in the pot, cover with a lid and cook for an additional 12-15 minutes. Leave the pot undisturbed for at least 10 minutes before you check!</li>
	<li>After 10-12 minutes, you can check your dumplings and taste them to see if they're done. You know they're finished when the middle is no longer gooey or doughy. Once finished, turn off heat and stir in the chopped parsley. Sprinkle with black pepper and a pinch of pink salt, if desired.</li>
